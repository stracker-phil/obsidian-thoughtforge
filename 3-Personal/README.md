# About Me

This folder contains documentation about my life outside of work and projects. I use it to keep track of important personal information and references I need occasionally.

## Key Content

- [[@My Full Name]]
- [[My Rental Agreement]]

## How I Use This Section

I organize personal reference materials here that don't fit in work or quest folders. This includes my personal contacts, important documents, and routines for my daily life.

Unlike my knowledge folders that focus on learning and growth, this section serves as a practical reference for navigating my personal life. I generally don't link these notes to other sections since they serve different purposes.

When something is both personal and knowledge-related (like a book I'm reading), I put the content in [[5-Knowledge/README|Knowledge]] and just reference it here.
