# My Job

This folder contains everything related to my professional work. I keep it separate from personal projects and reference materials.

## How I Use This Section

I store all job-specific materials here - from documentation about our tech stack to notes from important meetings. This includes references to colleagues, client information, and employer agreements.

When a work project generates reusable knowledge that is relevant _outside my job_, I move those insights to my [[5-Knowledge/README|Knowledge]] folder and link back to them from here.
