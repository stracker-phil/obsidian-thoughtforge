# My Journal

This folder is the living heart of my vault - the primary input stream for ideas and information that flow through my knowledge system.

## How I Use This Section

I write daily entries as my core note-taking routine. This is where all ideas begin before they mature into standalone notes elsewhere. My daily routine includes:

1. Opening today's journal first thing in the morning
2. Capturing thoughts, progress, and discoveries throughout the day
3. Reflecting on connections to previous work before closing

Unlike folders organized by topic, this chronological structure creates a complete timeline of my thinking. I don't worry about perfect organization here - I focus on consistent writing and honest reflection.

When patterns emerge or ideas solidify, I extract them to other folders but always maintain a link to their journal origins. This creates a traceable history of how my thoughts evolve.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

I've set up shortcuts to make journaling frictionless:

- `⌘ ⌥ O` - Open today's daily note
- `⌥ ←` - Navigate to previous day
- `⌥ →` - Navigate to next day

These shortcuts remove barriers to consistent journaling, which is crucial since this folder forms the foundation of my entire knowledge system. Almost every significant note in other folders began as a seed in my journal.
