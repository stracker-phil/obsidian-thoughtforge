This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin automatically colors your sidebar based on a color scheme you select. No configuration needed for single folders. No CSS tweaking needed. No folder prefixes needed.

I built this plugin because I wasn't satisfied with the options for colored sidebars that are currently available. There is no limit in the number of folders in your sidebar, as the color theme repeats infinitely. 


## Features

- 9 Color Themes compatible with both the dark and light mode of Obsidian.
  - 5 themes for a default rainbow color scheme starting at various colors. The default starts at green.
  - 2 special themes: Blue Wave which only uses blue colors, and Summer Vibes which uses a palette from red to yellow.
  - 1 mixed scheme for a sprinkle of randomness in your folder structure.
  - 1 Accessibility theme with colors that are easier to distinguish.
  - More coming soon!
- Automatic coloring of sub-folders and files, with an indicator for active files.
- Additional option to toggle an accessibility mode which increases the color contrast.
