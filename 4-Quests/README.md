# Quests

> [!info] Getting Started
> Consider, if you want to give this folder a different name that appeals to you. Suggestions are:
> - Projects
> - Ventures
> - Initiatives
> - Tasks

This folder contains my personal projects and learning journeys. I separate these from work projects and purely personal matters, using this space for intentional side projects that have clear goals.

## How I Use This Section

I create a separate subfolder for each quest, with its own folder note and supporting files. These projects typically span multiple months or are open-ended. Most of these quests involve learning new skills or creating something concrete.

My intention is to review this section weekly to keep momentum on my active quests and archive completed ones.
