I use this snippet to prepare for, or document meetings in my daily note entries. It's not a full note template, but a single block that I insert whenever needed.

Usage:
Use `⌘ ⌥ O` to open the current Daily note, place the cursor to the relevant place (usually at the end of the note), then hit `⌘ ⇧ N` (or "open insert template modal" command) and select this template.
