Setup guides document processes that are non-obvious or need some personalization. As noted in my core principles: I write those guides for myself, using my personal setup and configuration. The goal is to document technical processes for personal reusability.

Usage:
- Create a new file with the project name (like "Customer Site.md")
- Hit `⌘ ⇧ N` to select this template
