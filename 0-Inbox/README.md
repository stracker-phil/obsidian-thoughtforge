# The Inbox

**Create first, organize later!**

This is my capture zone for new thoughts, ideas, and information before organizing them.

## How I Use This Section

I write notes here without worrying about perfect organization. This creates a low-friction environment for capturing ideas quickly.

I review this folder regularly (ideally weekly) and move notes to their proper locations once I understand how they connect to my existing [[5-Knowledge/README|Knowledge]]. Some notes stay here for months until related ideas accumulate enough to justify a new structure.

This folder should ideally stay relatively small - if it grows too large, it's a sign I need to schedule time for processing and organizing.
