## Getting Started

### 1. Personalize Your Vault

- [ ] Review the [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/README|vault structure]] to understand the organization
- [ ] Rename the folder `2-Work` to include your company name (e.g., `2-Acme`)
- [ ] Open [[@My Full Name]], hit `F2` and rename the file to your name, e.g. `@Philipp Stracker`
- [ ] Optionally rename `4-Quests` to `4-Projects` or `4-Ventures` if you prefer a different folder name

### 2. Explore Key Features

- [ ] Learn about [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/File and Folder Naming|file naming conventions]] (prefixes like @, !, ?, ~)
- [ ] Understand how [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/Folder Notes|folder notes]] work with README files
- [ ] Review the [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/Keyboard Shortcuts|keyboard shortcuts]] for efficient workflow
- [ ] Discover important "Getting Started" sections throughout the vault by clicking [this search link](obsidian://search?query="Getting%20Started"%20-path:"/README.md") - once you complete the "Getting Started" item, delete it from your vault

### 3. Start Using the Vault

- [ ] Create your first note - hotkey `âŒ˜ N` (or `Ctrl N`)
- [ ] Create your first journal note - hotkey `âŒ˜ âŒ¥ O` (or `Ctrl Alt O`)
- [ ] Try the templates by creating a note and using `âŒ˜ â‡§ N` (or `Ctrl Shift N`)

### 4. For Developers: Extend Your Vault

- [ ] Check out [[5-Knowledge/Obsidian/How to Create a Custom Obsidian Plugin|how to create custom Obsidian plugins]] to extend your vault with personalized functionality
- [ ] Fork the [plugin template repository](https://github.com/stracker-phil/obsidian-plugin-template) to quickly get started with plugin development

### 5. Finish Onboarding

- [ ] Review and customize the templates in `_/Templates` to match your requirements
- [ ] Eventually delete this file or replace it with your personal dashboard

## Core Design Principles

ThoughtForge is built on principles documented in [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/Core Principles of This Vault|Core Principles]]:

- Write for yourself, not for public consumption
- Create first, organize later with the Inbox
- Focus on simplicity with fewer, well-used features
- Build connections between notes rather than perfect hierarchies

## Developer-Specific Resources

ThoughtForge includes resources specifically designed for developers:

- **Code snippet templates** - Capture and organize reusable code with the `~ Code Snippet.md` template
- **Decision documentation** - Track architectural and technical decisions with the `! Decision.md` template
- **Investigation logs** - Document debugging sessions and problem-solving with the `? Investigation.md` template
- **Plugin development guide** - Create custom Obsidian plugins using our [[5-Knowledge/Obsidian/How to Create a Custom Obsidian Plugin|developer guide]] and template repository
- **GitHub-like workflows** - familiar keyboard shortcuts and conventions that align with developer tools

Unlike general productivity templates, ThoughtForge is built by developers, for developers, with an emphasis on the unique needs of software engineering workflows.
