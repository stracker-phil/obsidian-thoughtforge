## Getting Started

### 1. Personalize Your Vault

- [ ] Review the [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/README|vault structure]] to understand the organization
- [ ] Rename the folder `2-Work` to include your company name (e.g., `2-Acme`)
- [ ] Open [[@My Full Name]], hit `F2` and rename the file to your name, e.g. `@Philipp Stracker`
- [ ] Optionally rename `4-Quests` to `4-Projects` or `4-Ventures` if you prefer a different folder name

### 2. Explore Key Features

- [ ] Learn about [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/File and Folder Naming|file naming conventions]] (prefixes like @, !, ?, ~)
- [ ] Understand how [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/Folder Notes|folder notes]] work with README files
- [ ] Review the [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/Keyboard Shortcuts|keyboard shortcuts]] for efficient workflow
- [ ] Discover important "Getting Started" sections throughout the vault by clicking [this search link](obsidian://search?query="Getting%20Started"%20-path:"/README.md") - once you complete the "Getting Started" item, delete it from your vault

### 3. Start Using the Vault

- [ ] Create your first note - hotkey `âŒ˜ N` (or `Ctrl N`)
- [ ] Create your first journal note - hotkey `âŒ˜ âŒ¥ O` (or `Ctrl Alt O`)
- [ ] Try the templates by creating a note and using `âŒ˜ â‡§ N` (or `Ctrl Shift N`)

### 4. Finish Onboarding

- [ ] Review and customize the templates in `_/Templates` to match your requirements
- [ ] Eventually delete this file or replace it with your personal dashboard

## Core Design Principles

ThoughtForge is built on principles documented in [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/Core Principles of This Vault|Core Principles]]:

- Write for yourself, not for public consumption
- Create first, organize later with the Inbox
- Focus on simplicity with fewer, well-used features
- Build connections between notes rather than perfect hierarchies
