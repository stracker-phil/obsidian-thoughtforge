# My Knowledge Base

This folder houses my long-term reference materials and documentation that I'll use across multiple projects and time periods.

## Key Content

- [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/README|ThoughtForge]]

## How I Use This Section

I store both conceptual knowledge and practical reference materials here. This includes:

- Technical documentation I want to preserve
- Guides and tutorials I've written for myself
- Best practices I've discovered
- Implementation patterns worth remembering
- Theoretical concepts and mental models

Unlike project folders that focus on immediate application, these notes capture what I want to retain **long-term**. I organize content by domain and create hub notes (prefixed with "+") to connect related topics.

When adding new content, notes often accumulate in the root folder for several weeks before I move them into a subfolder. This lets related ideas cluster naturally before formalizing their structure.
