# Obsidian

This folder contains my personal usage guide for Obsidian features, syntax, and workflows I've found valuable.

This section is closely related to the [[5-Knowledge/ThoughtForge/README|ThoughtForge]] section, but focusses on **How** to use Obsidian, rather than **Why** I do certain things.

## Key Content

- [[How to Create a Custom Obsidian Plugin]]
- [[How to Embed Search Queries]]

### From the ThoughtForge Documentation

- [[Which Plugins I Use and Why]]
- [[Keyboard Shortcuts]]

## How I Use This Section

I use this area to document Obsidian's markdown syntax, important settings, and details about installed community plugins.

Important: I want to keep this folder clean and concise, and only add syntax or details that I'm actively using _and_ spent some time to research or find out. E.g. there's no need to document how to create a markdown table or code block.
