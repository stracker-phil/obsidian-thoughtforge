# Folder Notes

> [!info]- Details
> This feature is provided by the community plugin "Folder Notes". You can customize the defaults in the settings.

Every folder in this vault can contain a `README.md` file - that file is called a **folder note**.
If that file is present, the folder name is underlined in the navigation sidebar. Clicking on the folder name will display its `README.md` file.

## What's the purpose?

Similar to the `README.md` in a git repo, the folder note can give you a quick context on what data the current folder should contain. It can also serve as an index file linking to other notes.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it concise**: Your folder note should provide just enough information to understand the folder's purpose
- **Include links**: Add links to key notes or subfolders to create a navigation hub
- **Maintain consistency**: Use a similar structure across different folder notes
- **Update when needed**: When adding new important content to a folder, update the README to reflect it

## Example Structure

A good folder note typically includes:

1. A brief description of the folder's purpose
2. Key categories or types of content found within
3. Links to the most important or frequently accessed notes
4. Any rules or conventions specific to that folder

This approach makes your vault more navigable and helps maintain clarity as your knowledge base grows.
