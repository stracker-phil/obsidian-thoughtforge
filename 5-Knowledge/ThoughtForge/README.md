# ThoughtForge Documentation

This section is the reference guide for how I've designed my note-taking system. I come back to these notes when I need to refresh my memory about how things work.

## Key Content

- [[Keyboard Shortcuts]]
- [[File and Folder Naming]]
- [[Folder Notes]]

## How I Use This Section

I document all system-wide decisions here - the foundational rules that shape how I use the entire vault. These notes answer the **Why** behind my approach and provide the **How** for consistent usage.

When I'm considering a change to my system, I revisit these documents first to make sure I'm honoring the principles I've set for myself. This prevents me from making impulsive changes that might create confusion later.

For area-specific conventions, I keep those in their respective **folder notes**. I try to minimize these "local rules" to keep my system simple and consistent across areas.

Unlike most sections that grow organically, I intentionally keep this documentation minimal - only adding what's necessary to maintain the system. If something isn't worth documenting, it's probably not worth implementing.
