# Why I Avoid Hierarchical Naming

I intentionally chose a **folder-based structure** over hierarchical naming systems for my vault. While hierarchical approaches initially seemed appealing, I realized they contradict my [[Core Principles of This Vault]].

## The Hierarchical Approach

Systems like Dendron use strong hierarchies, usually with dot-based naming (e.g., `project.feature.bug` or `knowledge.thoughtforge.principles`) to organize notes. This creates a structured taxonomy with powerful lookup capabilities and enforced organization.

## My Decision

After consideration, I'm sticking with a traditional folder structure rather than implementing such a hierarchical naming system.

## Reasoning

1. **Capture Velocity Over Perfect Organization**
	- I prioritize quick idea capture via the [[0-Inbox/README|Inbox]] or [[1-Journal/README|Journal]]
	- Hierarchical naming adds cognitive overhead at the critical moment of idea creation
	- "Create first, organize later" becomes significantly harder when every note needs taxonomic placement
   
2. **Decision Paralysis**
	- As a developer, I already face naming challenges in code (functions, variables, ...)
	- Adding this same mental load to note-taking introduces unnecessary friction
	- A simple and slowly growing folder structure requires fewer upfront decisions

3. **Flexibility and Evolution**
	- Folder-based organization allows easy movement of notes without breaking internal links
	- Hierarchies become rigid once established and are harder to refactor
	- My vault needs to evolve with me, and hierarchies can "lock me in" to early decisions

4. **Simplicity**
	- Getting started fast with little friction is important to build and establish good habits
	- Adding hierarchical complexity raises the learning curve and increases chances of abandonment
	- Quote: _"The best knowledge system is the one I actually use daily"_

5. **Avoiding Perfectionism**
	- Hierarchies trigger my tendency to overthink and seek "perfect" categorization
	- This leads to spending too much time organizing rather than creating
	- I prefer pragmatic, usable structures over theoretically perfect ones

**In short**: While hierarchical organization offers theoretical benefits, my perfectionism and desire for structure would make me less productive. Folders provide enough organization without the overhead.
