I follow these naming patterns to keep my vault organized. These aren't rigid rules - they evolve as my needs change, but consistency helps me find things quickly.

## File Prefixes

I use prefixes to identify file types at a glance. The prefix can be followed by a space, but that's optional.

| Prefix | Usage             | Sample                            |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **@**  | People notes      | `@John Doe.md`                    |
| **!**  | Decision notes    | `! Switch to TypeScript.md`       |
| **?**  | Investigation log | `? Credit card payment issues.md` |
| **~**  | Code snippets     | `~ Redux action thunk.md`         |

## Folder Structure

### Top-level Organization
- I use numeric prefixes for main folders (`0-Inbox`, `5-Knowledge`)
- This creates a logical order and groups similar content

### Subfolders
- No numeric prefixes needed (`AI`, `ThoughtForge`)
- I use title case (capitalize first letter of each word)

### Singular vs. Plural

I'm consistent with how I name different types of folders:

- Singular for concept folders: `Tool`, `Project`, `Agent`
- Plural for collection folders: `Templates`, `Prompts`, `Scripts`

### Abbreviations

I stick with one format for abbreviations (always `AI`, never `A.I.`)

I revisit these conventions periodically to make sure they still serve my workflow. The goal isn't perfect organization but making information easy to find for my future self.
