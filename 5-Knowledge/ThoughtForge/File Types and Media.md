# File Types and Media

I've tried several approaches of storing different files in the vault. Here is my discovery.

## Good Vault Files

In my experience, the following file types are ideal for storage inside this vault:

- ok: Markdown
- ok: Images
- ok: PDFs

### Why I Store Them In My Vault

Markdown is the primary format for all notes. This is where my actual thinking happens.

Images, like screenshots enrich my notes while respecting the plain text format of markdown.

PDFs are a valuable addition, as Obsidian can index and search for content of PDF files.

> [!info] Every file should have a descriptive file name
> I do not want to search for references of what `image1.png` could mean!
>
> My rule: Every non-markdown file starts with a date-prefix `yyyy-mm-dd` to document the date when it was added + a concise name describing its content.

## Other Files

Other files are better stored outside the vault, in a different Documents folder:

- bad: Office documents
- bad: Zip archives
- bad: Resources like Fonts, PSDs
- bad: Executable scripts, like shell scripts
- bad: Other files like binaries

Rather than storing those types of files in my vault, I prefer to add a note with a link to their external location.

### Why Those Files Are Bad

They do not provide value as they are not searchable or editable in Obsidian. Usually, they are big and just add bloat to the vault, slowing down the sync process.
