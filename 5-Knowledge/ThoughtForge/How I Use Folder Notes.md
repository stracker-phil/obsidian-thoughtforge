# How I Use Folder Notes

> [!info]- Details

I use `README.md` files (folder notes) in my vault folders to provide context and navigation. When a folder has a README, its name appears **underlined** in the sidebar. Clicking an underlined folder name **opens the README file** instead of expanding the folder.

## Why I Use Them

Folder notes help me maintain clarity as my knowledge base grows. I use them like READMEs in code repositories - they explain what belongs in a section and provide quick access to important content.

## My Approach

I keep my folder notes simple and focused:

- **Brief context**: Just enough information to remind myself what belongs here
- **Navigation links**: Direct access to notes I reference frequently
- **Key principles**: Any specific conventions I follow for this area
- **Minimal maintenance**: I only update these when the folder's purpose evolves

I don't try to document everything in a folder - that would create unnecessary maintenance work. Instead, I focus on capturing the essential purpose and most important connections.

## My Folder Note Structure

My typical folder note includes:

1. A single-paragraph description of what belongs in this space
2. Links to 3-5 cornerstone notes in this area (no exhaustive lists)
3. Any specific conventions I follow for this section
4. Occasional reminders to my future self about how this area connects to others

This approach supports my linked thinking by creating clear connection points between different sections of my vault. Rather than perfect organization, I focus on making navigation intuitive for my future self.
