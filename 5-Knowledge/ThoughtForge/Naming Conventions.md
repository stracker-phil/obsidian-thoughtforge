This vault follows consistent naming patterns to maintain organization and clarity.

## Folders

- **Top-level folders**: Use numeric prefixes followed by hyphen (e.g., `0-Inbox`, `5-Knowledge`)
- **Subfolders**: No numeric prefixes (e.g., `AI`, `ThoughtForge`)
- **Capitalization**: Use title case for all folders (capitalize first letter of each word)
- **Singular vs. Plural**:
	- Use singular for concept/category folders: `Tool`, `Project`, `Agent`
	- Use plural for collection folders: `Templates`, `Prompts`, `Scripts`
- **Consistency**: Keep abbreviations consistent (e.g., always use "AI" not "A.I.")
