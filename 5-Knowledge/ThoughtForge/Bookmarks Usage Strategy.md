# Bookmarks Usage Strategy

> [!note] Getting Started
> If you're new to ThoughtForge, consider disabling this core plugin initially to focus on building fundamental note-taking habits first.

I use bookmarks as a temporary workspace for active notes rather than long-term reference storage - a decision that supports my [[Core Principles of This Vault#Focus|Focus]] principle.

## How I Use Bookmarks

I use the core **Bookmarks plugin** to track:

1. Notes I'm actively working on
2. Relevant context notes - like due invoices, or active projects
3. Reference materials needed for current tasks

## Workflow Guidelines

- Keep the bookmark list intentionally short
- **Remove items** once they're no longer actively needed
- Treat bookmarks as a workspace, not an archive
- Regularly review and clean up the list

## When Not To Use Bookmarks

Bookmarks aren't meant for permanent reference or long-term storage. For those needs, I rely on:

- Well-structured notes with meaningful links
- Folder organization for broader categorization
