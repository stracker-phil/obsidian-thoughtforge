# Core Principles of This Vault

This vault is built around core principles that guide effective note-taking practice. These principles help me maintain a useful, sustainable knowledge management system:

## Write for Yourself

These notes are for me, not for public consumption. I write in my own voice, skip details obvious to me, and focus on what matters to my work and thinking.

## Create First, Organize Later

The `0-Inbox` folder exists for a good reason. I capture thoughts there without worrying about perfect organization. Only after collecting several related notes do I consider creating new structures.

## Simplicity

I prioritize fewer features that I'll use daily rather than many features I'll rarely touch. Every element in this vault should earn its place through regular use.

## Focus

Obsidian is a note-taking system - nothing more. I don't try to replace my calendar, task manager, or database tools. Each tool should do what it does best.

## Evolution

My vault grows and changes with me. When I discover that something is not working or missing, I adjust structures, change conventions, and add features. It's impossible to build "the perfect system" upfront.

## Routines First

Strong routines form the foundation of effective note-taking. I start with just daily notes and expanded as my routine gets stronger and my note taking skills grow.

## No Redundancy

I avoid duplicate meta-information. For example, a note in the `1-Journal` folder doesn't need a `#journal` tag - its location already tells me what it is. Less metadata means less maintenance.

## Linked Thinking

Connections between notes matter more than perfect categorization. I focus on creating links between related ideas to form "knowledge clusters" rather than building complex folder hierarchies.
