# AI: Prompts

This folder contains my **reusable prompt templates** for consistent interactions with AI systems.

## How I Use This Section

I collect effective prompts organized by their purpose rather than the specific AI tool. This includes:

- Task-specific prompt patterns
- Instruction formats I've refined through testing
- Template structures for recurring needs

Unlike the [[5-Knowledge/AI/Agents/README|AI Agents]] folder that contains complete systems, these are modular prompt components which are usually much shorter and copy-pasteable. I document patterns that produce reliable results across multiple tools.

These prompts can be used in two cases:

1. Start a conversation with a default service model, like Claude Sonnet
2. Inserted into an ongoing conversation to get a predictable response
