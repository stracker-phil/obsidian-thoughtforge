# AI: Tools

This folder documents AI products or services I'm personally using.

## How I Use This Section

I maintain reference notes about AI tools I've evaluated, used in the past, or am currently using. Some details that I try to capture - though, more of a suggestion than a rule:

- Feature comparisons between similar tools
- API documentation summaries
- Security and data privacy concerns
- Usage limits and pricing options
- Response quality, integrations, ease of use

When evaluating new tools, I document my findings here to avoid repeating research later. Of course, these notes are highly subjective and reflect my opinion.
