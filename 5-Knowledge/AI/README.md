# AI

This folder contains my knowledge about AI systems, models, and techniques. I track my experiences with various AI tools and collect reusable approaches here.

## How I Use This Section

I organize my AI knowledge into separate categories:

- Root folder: General AI concepts, model capabilities, and my experiences
- **Agents**: Complete "agent" definitions with system instructions ready to deploy in specific AI tools
- **Prompts**: Reusable prompts I've tested and refined (organized by purpose)
- **Tools**: Documentation about specific AI products I use or have evaluated

When I discover a useful technique or pattern, I document it here first before implementing it in my workflow - specially in this section, I want to include a lot of web links to keep sources and external references clear.
